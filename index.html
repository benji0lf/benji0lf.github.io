        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Benjamin Flores. I am currently 24 years old and live in Fresno, CA. I work full-time and take online classes part-time. I am currently in CIT-82 which is my reason for creating this site along with practicing and learning how to design websites.</p>

        <h2>CIT-82</h2>
        <p>So far this class has been very informative and I've learned so much in the 4 weeks I've been in it. Though some concepts could be tough to pick up on, I am very excited to continue learning and expanding my knowledge to hopefully land a job as a web developer some day.</p>
